# Web Development Projects

Frontend projects built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🚀 What it is
A collection of small, focused frontend demos and practice projects for learning and experimenting with common web techniques (UI components, DOM manipulation, browser APIs, and basic app patterns).

## 🛠️ What’s used
- HTML5 (semantic markup)  
- CSS3 (responsive layout, Flexbox/Grid)  
- JavaScript (ES6+) — main language for interactivity  
- TypeScript (used in some demos)  
- Browser APIs: Fetch, LocalStorage, Canvas, Web Audio, SpeechSynthesis, etc.

## ⚡ How to run
- Clone the repo and open a project's HTML file in your browser, or run a simple static server (e.g., VS Code Live Server or `python -m http.server`).

## 🔎 Notes
- Some demos store data in localStorage.  
- Projects using TypeScript need compilation to JavaScript.  
- API-based demos may require keys and modern browsers.
